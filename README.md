Scientific and Graphical calculator is a basic, semi-minimalist calculator that has a number of essentials functions used in science and math classes.
A simple user interface has been created to demonstrate the calculator. 

The calculator has lots of functions such as the basic operations, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic values. It follows the rule of BODMAS and also can be used for calculations involving large numbers.

A graphing calculator has the ability to display plotted graphs for complex equations such as trigonometric functions and other plotted results. The graph can be used for really small scale.

Implementation Our team addressed the problem that scientific calculators are expensive and are not easily available, even sometimes they are complicated to use, so we decided to replicate the math functions of the hardware calculator into our project using Python 3 , even further improved and added functions to it.

Tools And Techniques used - Tkinter Module, pyplot module, math module, user defined functions
It follows the rule of BODMAS.
The calculator has lots of functions.
